# Gif Search

> Search and download GIFs from Tenor through a controlled command-line workflow.

This repository packages one focused Hermes skill as a public, documentation-first capability. The blueprint below explains the actual operating surfaces, control points, failure paths, and evidence expected from a trustworthy run.

## The problem it solves

Research is hard to trust when source collection, interpretation, and conclusions are not visibly connected.

## System components

- **Search phrase**
- **Tenor search endpoint**
- **Relevance and content filter**
- **Preview candidates**
- **Downloaded GIF**

## Execution walkthrough

1. **Convert intent into concise search terms**
2. **Query Tenor with a bounded result count**
3. **Inspect previews dimensions and source links**
4. **Filter irrelevant or unsafe results**
5. **Download only the selected asset**
6. **Report attribution and local path**

## Example request

> For a narrow, non-sensitive research question, search and download GIFs from Tenor through a controlled command-line workflow. Return the result, the evidence used to verify it, and any limitations or actions that still require approval.

## Evidence contract

- `request.json` — captures request.
- `inspection.json` — captures inspection.
- `preview.json` — captures preview.
- `execution.json` — captures execution.
- `verification.json` — captures verification.
- `receipt.json` — captures receipt.

A run is complete only when the final artifact can be reopened or re-read and compared with the requested acceptance criteria. An attempted command or successful API response alone is not sufficient proof.

## Safety boundaries

- Confirm the exact target, owner, environment, and authority before acting.
- Preview consequential changes and pause at the approval gate.
- Keep credentials, personal data, and private endpoints out of logs and examples.
- Preserve user work and avoid unrelated changes.
- Report verification failures as incomplete work.

Read [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), and the detailed [How it works](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) guide before connecting this workflow to a real service or production environment.

## Maturity

This is a public reference workflow extracted from a larger private workbench. It does not include a hosted runtime, credentials, or private infrastructure. Adopters must connect compatible tools and validate behavior in their own environment.

## Contributing

Contributions should improve capability accuracy, safe defaults, reproducible examples, or verification evidence without broadening the skill beyond its stated purpose. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
